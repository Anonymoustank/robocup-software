.. py:class:: Keepaway

   Bases: :py:obj:`stp.play.Play`

   Play that passes repeatedly, effectively playing keepaway.
   See tick() for more details.

   .. py:method:: tick(self, world_state: stp.rc.WorldState) -> List[rj_msgs.msg.RobotIntent]

      init: assign one pass tactic, several seekers
      pass_active: execute that one pass
      when tactic needs new roles: assign_roles -> active
      when pass_done: return to init
      (the effect is to pass indefinitely)
