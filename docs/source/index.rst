Welcome
===================================================

This is the documentation for RoboJackets' RoboCup Software team. We are a
primarily undergraduate robotics team affiliated with Georgia Tech who compete
in the RoboCup Small Size League. See 
`their website <https://ssl.robocup.org/about/>`_ for 
more details on the competition.
