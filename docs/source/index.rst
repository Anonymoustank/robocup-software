Welcome
===================================================

This is the documentation for RoboJackets' RoboCup Software team. We are a
primarily undergraduate robotics team affiliated with Georgia Tech who compete
in the RoboCup Small Size League. See 
`their website <https://ssl.robocup.org/>`_ for more details on the competition.

To see when any documentation page was last updated, click "Edit on GitHub" in
the top right, then see the timestamp on the last commit. (Exception: the pages
under "API Reference" are auto-generated based on the docstrings in the Python
portion of our codebase, and thus are always up-to-date.)
